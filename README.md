# Random word problem by groovemonkey

## Background
Since there are a lot of bugs in the original code and I did not trust the results shown in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICZKZQowiHs) where Elixir and Go are compared, I tried to fix the code on my own, respecting the "bad" approach of generating a long word and checking afterwards if it is unique.

Clearly, this was designed to have bigger load on the CPU both in Go and Elixir.

#### Benchmark #1

Specs
```
Operating System: Linux
CPU Information: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor
Number of Available Cores: 16
Available memory: 15.58 GB
Elixir 1.16.2
Erlang 26.2.4
JIT enabled: true
```

I first of all fixed the code and used a different approach on checking on uniqueness. Already used words are stored in a map for the `n_words` runs. All the `n_words_vec` runs are similar to the original code, resulting in **O(n^2)**

```

As you see, somewhere between `n=55` and `n=555`, `n_words` is faster than `n_words_vec` approach.
